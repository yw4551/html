	<h3>music history</h3>
	Already in the Bible we see that the father of the 	percussion instrument (violin and harp) was Yuval 	ben Lemech and in fact he was the inventor of the 	instrument.<br>
	There are few archeological finds of simple 	musical instruments from the Paleolithic period. 	The oldest example is a flute made on a long bone 	of an eagle that was discovered in a cave in 	Germany from the Uriniak culture about 40,000 	years ago.
	Anthropologists estimate that music evolved in 	early times initially as an imitation of animal 	sounds.
	The next stage in the development of music is when 	it was already written and noted as "ancient 	music".<br>
	The oldest "song" in the world is, according to 	Anne Drapcorn-Kilmer, who researched the subject, 	written in cuneiform and originated in light about 	4,000 years ago.
	Drapcorn-Kilmar found a triangular rhythm (found 	in ancient Egyptian poetry) written on a diatonic 	scale.
	There is some evidence from ancient times that 	suggests the use of various musical instruments - 	paintings on urns and written descriptions of 	music indicate the use of musical instruments such 	as double tubes that are like a primitive flute 	and polyphony.
	Descriptions of similar developments appear in 	both Indus Valley culture and Aristotle's 	writings.<br>
	In prehistoric times music was probably based on 	rhythm and melody and harmony came at a much later 	time.
	Prehistoric music seems to have been played by 	percussion (stones, sticks, bones, hunting 	instruments) and human voice.
	It is not known how ancient music really sounded 	and scholars are only able to guess it from finds 	from the Early Stone Age such as bones with holes 	punched in their sides.
	Musical instruments such as a seven-hole flute and 	various types of strings have also been found at 	archeological sites of the Indus Valley culture. 	<br>
	<h3>types of music</h3>
	Almost all genres of popular music in the last 	century came from the United States.
	This is where African and European musical 	traditions came together and it is this blend of 	traditions that has spawned popular music.
	A genre of music is a conventional category that 	identifies parts of music as belonging to a common 	tradition or group of conventions.
	Music can be divided into different types in many 	different ways.
